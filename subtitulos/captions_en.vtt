Hello everyone, today I’ll show you how to use
the Medical Encyclopaedia by Javi and Álvaro,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.840
a website for quickly and easily finding
medical terms.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.760
When you enter, you’ll see a search bar at the
top and, just below, buttons with letters of the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.840
alphabet. These allow you to easily navigate
based on the initial letter of the condition you’re looking for.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.480
To find a condition, click on the letter that
its name starts with, like “A”

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.160
for “allergies” or “anxiety” or “D” for
“diabetes.” This will take you to an index

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.600
of conditions beginning with that letter.
Within the index, select the specific condition

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.840
you’re looking for. You’ll find a brief, direct
explanation, and in some cases, charts or diagrams

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:01.160
that help you understand the term quickly.
You can return to the main menu or the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.920
list of letters to continue exploring
additional terms.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.280
And that’s it! Now you know how to use
the Medical Encyclopaedia by Javi and Álvaro

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.560
to consult medical terms quickly
and effectively. Thanks for watching!
